# Color-Picker-Project
App that allows you to swap through colors to try and find a color Palette that you like. Used Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3 to create this project.
Within the app you can randomize, adjust and save color palettes. You're able to adjust the hue, brightness and saturation to get the color that you want.
the colors will be displayed in hex code. The palettes that you save are stored in localStorage so until you close the window, your able to view everything that you've 
saved even while refreshing the page. You're also able to lock a color in place if you happen to find only one or only a few that you like so that you can keep randomzing
the rest of the colors.
